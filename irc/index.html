<h1>Some History <small>Because some things need explaining</small></h1>
</div>
<p>From the earliest stages of the development of the Gilgi.org network, 
it was clear that it would never be complete without its own IRC server. 
This dream was finally achieved in February of 2012, when the gilgiNET 
IRC network went live for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing good lasts forever, and the IRC server was 
taken down on March 8th, 2012, mainly because of the system resources it 
was taking up, but also because nobody ever came to talk to me on it.</p>
<p>Upon the dismantling of gilgiNET, Scoot's Canoe migrated back to its 
origins on coldfront, where it can still be found today.</p>
