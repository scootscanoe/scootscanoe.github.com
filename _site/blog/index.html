  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/10/07/official-announcement-on-the-kicking-of-nathan-davis">Official Anouncement on the Kicking of Nathan Davis</a></h2>
  <p>Posted by Thomas on 07 October 2012</p>
</div>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Some people (most notably Nathan) have voiced concerns about the recent actions taken by Scoot&#8217;s Canoe (most notably the kicking of Nathan from Scoot&#8217;s Canoe). The purpose of this document is to clear up the confusion surrounding the events of the evening September 30th, 2012. Personally, I feel that I have spent enough time explaining the situation, so I have decided to mostly let the chatlogs speak for themselves (though I have added some additional comments to further clarify the situation). All timestamps are Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
<h3>Disrespect to Scoot&#8217;s Canoe</h3>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:24:48 PM] Nathan Davis: Well I think it is funny to tell people in pubs we are the shitty cocks</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:31:55 PM] Nathan Davis: Like, Scoots Canoe pretty much never meant anything to anyone.</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:25:22 PM] Nathan Davis: And since the name and brand of Scoots Canoe is just a random worthless remnant for the old lanners to reminisce about and doesnt actually hold any value to us.</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:21:45 PM] Nathan Davis: Basically<br>
[9/30/2012 6:22:05 PM] Nathan Davis: This entire split is to spite Sam and the old lan crew</em></p>
<p>In addition to this short list of rather mild disrespectful comments, please also consider the fact that the entire &#8220;Shitty Cocks&#8221; fiasco was, at least implicitly, extremely disrespectful of Scoot&#8217;s Canoe.</p>
<h3>Did Nathan really leave Scoot&#8217;s Canoe?</h3>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:27:31 PM] Nathan Davis: So basically Scoots Canoe is just a name to us, and a name we dont like as much as the one we came up with.<br>
[9/30/2012 6:27:49 PM] Nathan Davis: So we ditched it/</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:39:46 PM] Nathan Davis: You are always welcome in Shitty Cocks.<br>
[9/30/2012 6:39:59 PM] Nathan Davis: We are a very accepting organization.</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:53:34 PM] Nathan Davis: The Shitty Cocks are among you as we speak</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:25:36 PM] Nathan Davis: We decided to make a split<br>
[9/30/2012 6:26:02 PM] Nathan Davis: Thus rather than [SC] we changed our tags to [$&cent;]</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 7:19:51 PM] Nathan Davis: Aaron are you a proud member of the Shitty Cocks?<br>
[9/30/2012 7:20:12 PM] aaron ossino: [$&cent;] go hard</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 7:30:21 PM] Nathan Davis: OK so we basically left.</em></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not already clear what I&#8217;m getting at here, note the verb tenses in these chat messages.</p>
<h3>My stance</h3>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:58:27 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: I do what sc decides</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:59:41 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: The server belongs to scoots canoe<br>
[9/30/2012 6:59:48 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: You are a shitty cock<br>
[9/30/2012 7:00:06 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: Idk what isn&#8217;t clear with this picture</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 7:22:16 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: Banning shitty cocks from ts is not my job or jurisdiction until we talk about this as a group and not you talking to me about it by ourselves.</em></p>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 7:31:48 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: I plan on doing absolutely nothing at the moment</em></p>
<p>Indeed, I took no action until 10:19pm when I had confirmed that the implicit Scoot&#8217;s Canoe leadership was in favor of taking such action. Thus, I took no action on my own; rather, Scoot&#8217;s Canoe took the action. I merely happened to be the spokesperson and the executor of the Teamspeak ban.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 10:19:05 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: yeah ok heres how it goes<br>
[9/30/2012 10:19:15 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: nathan is banned from skype<br>
[9/30/2012 10:19:19 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: nathan is banned from ts<br>
[9/30/2012 10:19:27 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: nathan is to be kicked from steam group<br>
[9/30/2012 10:19:33 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: further sanctions tba<br>
[9/30/2012 10:19:40 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: any questions?<br>
[9/30/2012 10:20:29 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: other shitty cocks members welcome to leave steam group if they want<br>
[9/30/2012 10:20:58 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: otherwise will probably be kicked or looked at least funny if they have the shitty cocks tag<br>
[9/30/2012 10:21:23 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: if anyone wants to discuss a name change besides nathan who has no rights we can talk about it in the skype chat<br>
[9/30/2012 10:21:49 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: the ban is a combination of two factors<br>
[9/30/2012 10:22:16 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: 1) shitty cocks schismed unilaterally from scoots canoe and therefore have no claim to any scoots canoe servers, groups, etc<br>
[9/30/2012 10:22:32 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: 2) nathan has shown extreme disrespect for scoots canoe<br>
[9/30/2012 10:23:09 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: if anyone has any comments or concerns they can post them in the skype chat unless they are nathan or they can pm me on skype or steam directly<br>
[9/30/2012 10:23:36 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: nathan can comment or appeal to me directly via pm on skype or steam<br>
[9/30/2012 10:23:48 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: good evening gentlemen</em></p>
<p>This is the verdict as given by me, representing Scoot&#8217;s Canoe as the senior member in the channel. It was made with the support of the majority of the implicit leadership of Scoot&#8217;s Canoe. The specific and final charges against the accused are made explicit in the verdict. While no written rules for Scoot&#8217;s Canoe existed at the time, the primary charge (charge 1) is clearly a logical reaction and does not need an explicit rule.</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine a set of rules for a gaming clan that allow extreme disrespect for the clan, but in my opinion it is reasonable to expect that, normatively speaking, a &#8220;good&#8221; set of rules should be at least partially based on respect. Furthermore, I claim that it is implicit that Scoot&#8217;s Canoe is and always has striven to be a clan of &#8220;good&#8221; people who try to show respect to others, and not a clan of people who strive only to show disrespect.</p>
<h3>What is this &#8220;implicit leadership&#8221; bullshit?</h3>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 6:16:05 PM] Nathan Davis: The leadership and decision making for this group is centralized in a small group of long time members.</em></p>
<p>Scoot&#8217;s Canoe has been around for a long time now. We have generally gotten along well together and have not had a pressing need for codified rules or leadership structures besides the temporary, special purpose structures like the committee in charge of the Internationoob. However, at the end of the day, the people who created Scoot&#8217;s Canoe have an undeniable and inherent right and responsibility to defend Scoot&#8217;s Canoe against disrespect and dishonor. They also have an inherent claim to making executive decisions that follow from straight logic (e.g., revoking Teamspeak rights of people who have left Scoot&#8217;s Canoe on bad terms).</p>
<p>This seems pretty straightforward to me, but some people have voiced concerns about this unspoken, common-sense-based system. Thus, Scoot&#8217;s Canoe has codified the Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities of Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Members. This codification is not an attempt to justify the actions of Scoot&#8217;s Canoe ex post facto. The actions of Scoot&#8217;s Canoe have already been sufficiently justified. Instead, this codification serves exclusively to clarify and make even more obvious certain concepts that already exist on the unspoken, common-sense level.</p>
<h3>Reacceptance into Scoot&#8217;s Canoe</h3>
<p><em>[9/30/2012 9:29:26 PM] Nathan Davis: Fuck you thomas. I dont need you, your shitty dota play, or your shitty server.</em></p>
<p>With an attitude like that, it&#8217;s not likely &#8211; but we never say never. People sometimes say or do things that they later regret. As stated in the verdict, Scoot&#8217;s Canoe is open to listening to Nathan&#8217;s comments and concerns.</p>
<p>However, at the time of this writing, Nathan has only shown continued disrespect for Scoot&#8217;s Canoe and its members. Furthermore, he has shown blatant disrespect for the verdict issued by Scoot&#8217;s Canoe by circumventing his Teamspeak ban. Thus, at the current time, Scoot&#8217;s Canoe is not prepared to readmit Nathan into the group.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/30/minor-site-updates">Minor Site Updates</a></h2>
  <p>Posted by Thomas on 30 September 2012</p>
</div>
<p>The Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Tech Committee continued to roll out minor improvements to the website through the last week of September. In addition to the Teamspeak status checking mentioned in <a href="/blog/2012/09/24/ts-mess-finally-resolved/">this blog post</a>, we have also introduced similar status checking (through some very slick <span class="caps">JSONP</span> APIs provided by <a href="http://flask.gilgi.org">flask.gilgi.org</a>) for the <a href="/css">CS:S server</a> and for the <a href="/ventrilo">Ventrilo sever</a>, which, although seldom used by Scoot&#8217;s Canoe members, now has its own page under <a href="/servers">Servers</a>. Of course, the statuses for all these servers and everything else on the network can also be checked live at <a href="http://status.gilgi.org">status.gilgi.org</a>.</p>
<p>In the near future, the Tech Committee plans to finally do something about the lack of a real <a href="/about">About</a> page. Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to contact us with any suggestions, comments, complaints, or bug reports.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/24/ts-mess-finally-resolved">TS Mess Finally Resolved</a></h2>
  <p>Posted by Thomas on 24 September 2012</p>
</div>
<p>After a long summer of spotty Teamspeak availability and dissatisfaction with the overly-confusing backup server solution, the Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Technical Committee has finally gotten around to cleaning up the mess that was the Scoot&#8217;s Canoe voice communications infrastructure. The old primary Teamspeak server has been officially retired, and the backup Teamspeak server is now the official Teamspeak server. The result is that <a href="ts3server://ts.gilgi.org/?port=9001&amp;nickname=Guest">ts.gilgi.org:9001</a> is <em>the</em> Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Teamspeak Server and no one has to worry about keeping track of which server is the currently active server. This server is hosted by Amazon for increased uptime and reliability. Finally, the server status shown at <a href="http://status.gilgi.org">status.gilgi.org</a> and at the <a href="/teamspeak">Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Teamspeak server page</a> is now updated live.</p>

  <p>Posted by Thomas on 22 September 2012</p>
</div>
<p>This weekend, the Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Dota 2 Team adopted a new rotating Fleet Commander leadership system. The first two Captain&#8217;s Mode matches played under the new system were FC&#8217;d by Martin and Nathan. Both matches resulted in impressive wins for Scoot&#8217;s Canoe, providing validation for all the theorycrafting and debate flooding the Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Skype chat.</p>

  <p>Posted by Thomas on 22 September 2012</p>
</div>
<p>This weekend, Valve finally added the much anticipated hero Meepo the Geomancer to Dota 2. The Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Dota 2 Team decided to investigate the hero&#8217;s abilities in an in house bot match. The image below left speaks for itself, but the one number that sums it up best is Nathan&#8217;s 989 XP/min. Below right is a featured matchmaking game where Nathan went an impressive 18 and 7 in a 33 minute match.</p>

  <p>Posted by Thomas on 22 September 2012</p>
</div>
<p>This weekend, the Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Dota 2 Leadership Committee released the details of the upcoming Internationoob 2012 competition. The Internationoob is a hero-learning, skill-building program in which Scrub Tier members of the Scoot&#8217;s Canoe Dota 2 Team can progress to higher tiers of Dota 2 play. The contestants must win a total of five games (one of which must be played in Captain&#8217;s Mode) with a positive (K+A)/D ratio while playing a selected high tier hero. Doing so earns the contestant the point value (PV) assigned to that hero. Once a contestant reaches 70 total points, they &#8220;graduate&#8221; from Scrub Tier.</p>
<p>The details released this weekend include the final selection of top tier heroes as well as the point values that each hero has been assigned by the Committee. You can follow the progress of the Internationoob 2012 <a href="/internationoob">here</a>.</p>
