<h1>Some History <small>Because some things need explaining</small></h1>
</div>
<p>The members of Scoot's Canoe have dabbled in Minecraft on and off for years. 
Alex ran several reincarnations of a server for us over Hamachi (definitely not Hamacho) 
and we'd pour hundreds of man-hours into a world before getting bored and moving on to other, 
more important things like getting mad about HoN.</p>
<p>After Alex's last server was brought down sometime in 2011, the members of Scoot's Canoe 
joined another Minecraft server and played on the world that is now immortalized in 
<a href="http://map.gilgi.org">this map</a>. That server was reset on March 3rd, 2012, 
but Scoot's Canoe involvement on the world is steadily dying out.</p>
