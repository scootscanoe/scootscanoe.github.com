### Anime year

The 2017 anime year runs from Fall 2016 to Summer 2017, inclusive.

This includes the following seasons:

  - [Fall 2016](https://myanimelist.net/anime/season/2016/fall)
  - [Winter 2017](https://myanimelist.net/anime/season/2017/winter)
  - [Spring 2017](https://myanimelist.net/anime/season/2017/winter)
  - [Summer 2017](https://myanimelist.net/anime/season/2017/summer)

### Nomination procedures

All members who qualify to nominate an anime by the nomination day (Nov 1) will be ordered by random draw. They will each in turn nominate one anime that has not been nominated yet.

In 2017 we are introducing a special exemption policy, which will allow members who have not yet qualified to nominate an anime by the nomination day (Nov 1) will have until the nomination extension deadline (Nov 12) to finish qualifying and produce a nomination.

### What can be nominated?

Any anime which aired during the seasons in the anime year may be nominated. Refer to the MAL seasonal lists linked above for a comprehensive list.

OVAs, ONAs, movies, and other specials cannot be nominated.

Sequels to another anime may be nominated; however, voters will not be compelled to watch a sequel anime if it spoils any other shows.
