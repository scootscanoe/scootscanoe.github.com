<p>While IRC has a rich history and is a fantastic tradition, the majority of Scoot's Canoe's text chat communication in modern times takes place in Skype group chats. Skype's ubiquity, ease of use, and mobile presence make it the best choice for a group whose members may be on the go or simply to lazy to get on IRC. The Scoot's Canoe Skype group chat is the place for everything from making groups for games to planning LANs to heated debates about whether or not Yu-Gi-Oh is a good card game.</p>
