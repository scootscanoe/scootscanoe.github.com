The Officers of Scoot's Canoe, by a vote of 5/7 (Brian and Martin neither voting nor abstaining) > 2/3, have decided to kick Nathan from Scoot's Canoe for "creating a negative gaming enviroment for fellow clan members and not accepting the rules agreed upon by every other member of the clan." Nathan is hereby banned from TS and all other Scoot's Canoe services and servers and is no longer a member of the group.

That will be all.
