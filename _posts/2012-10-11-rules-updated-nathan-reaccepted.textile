The committee created by Alex charged with the creation of the new rules (Sam, Paul, Alex, and Martin) have concluded their deliberations and have unanimously passed the new version of the Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities of Scoot's Canoe Members. The new version is available at "http://scootscanoe.gilgi.org/rules":http://scootscanoe.gilgi.org/rules and is effective immediately.

The Officers of Scoot's Canoe, by a vote of 5/7 (Jake and Brian neither voting nor abstaining) > 2/3, have decided to reaccept Nathan into Scoot's Canoe. Nathan is hereby unbanned from TS and all other Scoot's Canoe services and servers and is a full member of the group.

If there are any typos or mistakes in the rules, or if any part of this statement appears to be in error please direct your comments to the Officers.
