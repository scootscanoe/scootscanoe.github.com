The hotly anticipated Scoot's Canoe debut in Dota 2 Portal League play on Saturday night resulted in overwhelming success for the pride of Omaha, Nebraska, as Martin captained a ragtag team, hastily assembled in the moments before the match, to a two-to-naught victory over the likes of Clan Dream.

Participants in the match from the Scoot's Canoe side included Vindicator, DirtyB, The Doctor, Housman, and manlyTomb, but the real story behind the sensational win lay in the week-plus of pre-match preparation dominated by the parsing and analysis of prior Clan Dream game results. With some ninety-odd game results compiled, each featuring multiple Clan Dream members, Scoot's Canoe was able to anticipate opposing strategy throughout the drafting phase, and as a result, went into the match with an early advantage. Of course, excellent play from the team saw this advantage through to fruition.

Early reports from the first game's drafting phase were optimistic. With their first two picks, Scoot's Canoe secured Dark Seer and Jakiro, two heroes whose dominating performances in the Dota 2 pro scene have often led them to be banned early in the draft. Played by Vindicator and manlyTomb, respectively, these heroes were complemented by Housman's Venomancer, Doctor's Sven, and DirtyB's Queen of Pain for a lineup full of team-fighting potential. This proved to be too much for Clan Dream to handle. Exceptional performances from Vindicator (6/2/20) and DirtyB (12/2/11) highlighted a polished effort from Scoot's Canoe - while experience and levels slightly favored Clan Dream even into the midgame, Scoot's Canoe did not trail their opponents in gold earned at any point. This disparity led to a 35-15 win.

The second game proved to be even more lopsided. Wary of the previous game's top performers, Clan Dream used two of their bans to remove Dark Seer and Queen of Pain from the pool of available heroes. Scoot's Canoe responded with a powerful ganking lineup, with Vindicator on Bounty Hunter, Doctor on Leshrac, manlyTomb on Visage, DirtyB on Night Stalker, and Housman on Sven. Early kills by an aggressive trilane of Housman, Doctor, and manlyTomb and an outstanding 23/4/6 performance from Vindicator led Scoot's Canoe to a 44-19 rout, leading Clan Dream in both experience and gold at all points of the game.

While Clan Dream struggled to contain Scoot's Canoe's impressive lineup, they were gracious in defeat. "WELL PLAYED SIR's" commented Clan Dream's Chlenix, at the conclusion of the second game. "Love it; gg guys," added ConnorBS. Scoot's Canoe's strong play in the first match of the Dota 2 Portal League is an encouraging sign of things to come. They are slated to face Noobs Becoming Pros in week two. Stay tuned!
